# The Inter-Con Security Recruiter-Tron!!!!

Use the Recruiter-Tron to keep track of Recruitment efforts:
 - Convenient tables to keep track of Positions and Candidates!
 - Full create/read/update/delete permissions, tied to a Mongo database to keep your data neat and tidy!
 - "Recruiter Resources" to see important contact info and consult the Recruiter's Checklist.
 - Google Maps from which Google driving directions can be launched within the App.
 - Reporting feature which shows the ratio of Open to Closed Positions and the ratio of Hired to Interview Candidates, as well as Positions by Client and Distribution by City.
 - Admin component which enables admin users to provision new users and update credentials (users are not allowed to self-authenticate).
 
-> This application is built using MERN!  
-> Authentication is with Passport, using a Local Strategy.  
-> New (to me) technology used are the Google Maps API and Chart.js, which was used for the reporting feature.  The React template was provided by wrappixel.com and utilized React- bootstrap-table, which incorporated useful features such as cell edit, sort, and full text search.
